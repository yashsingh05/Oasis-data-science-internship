Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Project Steps
Here are the key steps to create an email spam detector:

1. Data Collection
Obtain a labeled dataset of emails containing both spam and non-spam examples.
2. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the email text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
Tokenize the email text into words or phrases.
